# Contributing to DropDeep

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DropDeep!

## Guidelines

- **Keep changes focused and minimal** — Single-purpose pull requests are easier to review
- **Follow existing code style** — Match the patterns you see in the codebase
- **Test UI changes manually** — Ensure the desktop app remains responsive
- **Avoid breaking large-project scanning** — Performance and stability are critical

5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description
